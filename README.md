I'm a U.S. Marine Corps veteran specializing in cybersecurity analysis and engineering, with strong proficiency in Windows administration and DevOps. My experience includes vulnerability management using tools like Nessus and Security Center, as well as expertise in Group Policy (GPO) implementation, Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM), and DevOps practices for streamlined security operations. I am also well-versed in the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and DISA STIG compliance, bringing a disciplined, solutions-driven approach to securing systems and optimizing network defenses.
